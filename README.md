# Terminology

## What is NLP???? (Tasks in NLP)

* Similarity??? (word, sentence, article)
* Named entity recognition (NER)???
* Question Answering
* Text generation??
* Chatbot
* Machine Translation?
* Summarization?
* Sentiment Analysis?
* Classification of article?
* Correct words by OCR or speech recognition system?

### Design a model  
* Design models to solve above tasks?
* Design a model to find all the occurrences of quoted text in a news article
* Design a model to identifies whether the word "Apple" in a sentence belongs to the fruit or the company

# Must know

* Tokenizer, POS tag???????
* Stopwords??
* TFIDF????
* Word Embedding????

## Features of improving accuracy
* POS tag
* Counting frequency of words
* TODO: What else? (check the paper....)

## What is WordNet?? and what is Ontology (ConceptNet)?  
We can use WordNet to find synonyms and antonyms

## What is Lemmatization and Stemming (keyword normalization) in NLP????
* Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes.  
* Lemmatizing is also same like stemming but the difference is lemmantizing words known with dictionary.  

## How to remove punctuation?

## What is latent semantic indexing and where can it be applied?????

## What is dependency parsing?????  
It is the task of extracting a dependency parse of a sentence that represents its grammatical structure.  

A `dependency parser` analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence, establishing relationships between `head words` and words which modify those `heads`. (e.g., `faster` modifies `moving` in the following example)

* What library we can use
* What algorithm dependency parsing is using  
transition-based parsing algorithm  
* When to use dependency grammar structure  
Generate POS tag
