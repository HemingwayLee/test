# TODO
* docker: pgbouncer, hadoop, cron, docker django hot reloading
* Study Heroku (PaaS)
* AI: GloVe, pytroch, Lasso
* Search for top papers

* Python: [pip tool](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/)
* Django: 404, Audit table, rbac, Test, is django/nodejs async just like play framework? Make file upload async
```
python3 manage.py loaddata init_template.json
```

* Pandas always has index, if you dont need it, set it to false

# Blockchain
* The last mile of blockchain

## BTC
* [fixed supply](https://cryptoli.st/lists/fixed-supply)  
* How to have limited amount of BTC (in its protocol, in the config file, and the config file is hashed)
* Miner does not have to get `full node`
* Why no smart contract? smart contract is new, it is designed to be money system, no need to have smart contract
* BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal)

## BCH
* The block size is too small, BTC soluiton is `Segwit`
* Bigger blocks == more compute required == Big company is easier to compute == less decentralized

## Solidity
* No string array, floating
* Ethereum's Rust client Parity uses `rocksdb`, whereas Ethereum's Go, C++ and Python clients use `leveldb`

## Hyperledge
* For private blockchain
* it support confidential transactions (only visible for selected parties)
* it has 5 sub-projects
* Permissionless (B2C, C2C) and Permissioned (B2B). The Consensus algorithms are different from one another 
* Consensus algorithm is pluggable: Proof of Work, Proof of Stack, Proof of Elapsed Time
* Chaincode: like smart contract


## MultiChain (Private, Permissioned)
* Based on Bitcoin blockchain (but enhanced)

## 51% attack
* double spending
