Here comes the information of visiting TWTW:
- After TWTW visited JJJ last year, they are interested in the things we built in JJJ.
- TWTW is more conservative than JJJ, they only want to invest in something which customers will pay for it.
- In TWTW, there are no data scientists in the ITS team. If TWTW needs to do some researches, they will cooperate with some professors in colleges.
- In TWTW, most of the profit comes from Audit. They want to improve Audit related projects vary much.
  - If we can demo our Audit project or Tax project to TWTW, they might want to pay for the technologies/projects/source code we built in JJJ.
- James mentioned that we planned to have a hackathon to let developers from other country understand how to use CCCC, however it was cancelled due to covid19
  - TWTW wants to learn how to use CCCC, if we allow developers in Taiwan (and other countries) to use the SANDBOX environment in CCCC, I think they will definitely use CCCC in the future.
