# Why locatization
* For NLP, locatization is almost recreating another system
  * Chinese does not have tense, space in sentence. Malay does not have gender
  * Hieroglyph in Chinese and Egyptian
    * hard to pronounce
    * Japanese is kind of combination of 2 systems
  * Japanese has `けいご`

# Tokenizer
* spaCy does not support Japanese and Chinese
* spaCy can be extended with MeCab or Jieba
  * spaCy is more than tokenizer: NER, QA, w2v, visualization
  * different tokenizers in different language provides different information
